    <h1>Polar bears</h1>
    <p>The largest bear in the world and the Arctic's top predator, polar bears are a powerful symbol of the strength and endurance of the Arctic.<br> 
        The polar bear's Latin name, Ursus maritimus, means "sea bear." It's an apt name for this majestic species, which spends much of its life in, around, or on the ocean–predominantly on the sea ice. <br>
        In the United States, Alaska is home to two polar bear subpopulations.

        Considered talented swimmers, polar bears can sustain a pace of six miles per hour by paddling with their front paws and holding their hind legs flat like a rudder.<br>
         They have a thick layer of body fat and a water-repellent coat that insulates them from the cold air and water.<br>
        
        Polar bears spend over 50% of their time hunting for food.<br>
         A polar bear might catch only one or two out of 10 seals it hunts, depending on the time of year and other variables. <br>
         Their diet mainly consists of ringed and bearded seals because they need large amounts of fat to survive.<br>

        
        Polar bears rely heavily on sea ice for traveling, hunting, resting, mating and, in some areas, maternal dens.<br>
         But because of ongoing and potential loss of their sea ice habitat resulting from climate change–the primary threat to polar bears Arctic-wide–polar bears were listed as a threatened species in the US under the Endangered Species Act in May 2008. <br>
         As their sea ice habitat recedes earlier in the spring and forms later in the fall, polar bears are increasingly spending longer periods on land, where they are often attracted to areas where humans live.<br>

        
        The survival and the protection of the polar bear habitat are urgent issues for WWF. <br>
        In October 2019, the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Polar Bear Specialist Group released a new assessment of polar bear populations showing that the number of polar bear subpopulations experience recent declines has increased to four, with eight populations still being data-deficient.<br>
         The good news is that five populations are stable while two have been experiencing an upward trend.</p>

Due to climate change the Arctic is heating up twice as fast as anywhere else on the planet, shrinking the Arctic sea ice cover by 14% per decade.<br>
 Compared to the median sea ice cover recorded between 1981-2010, we have lost about 770,000 square miles, an area larger than Alaska and California combined.<br>

Fewer opportunities to feed<br>
Polar bears rely on sea ice to hunt seals, rest, breed, and store energy for the summer and autumn, when food can be scarce.<br>
 Sea ice now melts earlier in the spring and forms later in the autumn in the bears' southern range, like Hudson Bay and James Bay in Canada. <br>
 As the bears spend longer periods without food, their health declines.<br>
  For every week earlier that the ice breaks up in Hudson Bay, bears come ashore roughly 22 pounds lighter and in poorer condition.
  <br> In the US, polar bears have experienced significant changes to seasonal variability and availability of sea ice habitat.<br>
   For example, polar bears in the southern Beaufort Sea have recently experienced about twice as many reduced ice days over continental shelf waters than polar bears in the Chukchi and Bering Seas nearby. <br>
   As a result, polar bears studied in the Chukchi and Bering Seas were larger, in better condition, and had higher reproduction rates likely since they had more access to food and did not have to fast for as long in the spring as those living in the southern Beaufort Sea.<br>
    Bears must move longer distances to stay with the rapidly receding ice. <br>
    In most areas, they come ashore when ice melts and rely on fat stores until the ice refreezes so they can go back out to hunt.<br>
     Traditional prey species may be less accessible in a new sea ice environment, and seals that use the ice are predicted to fare poorly in the warming Arctic region.<br>

Fewer cubs<br>
Some polar bears may suffer from malnutrition.<br>
 In extreme cases they may face starvation–especially females with cubs. <br>
 Unhealthy bears can lead to lower reproduction rates and extinction in certain locations.<br>
  Scientists have found the main cause of death for cubs to be either lack of food or lack of fat on nursing mothers<br>

Habitat fragmentation<br>
Climate change is also resulting in more habitat fragmentation. <br>
As Arctic ice melts, polar bears are affected by increased shipping activities and a rise in opportunities for oil and gas development, that WWF is currently fighting against.
